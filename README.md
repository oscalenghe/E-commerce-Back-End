# E-commerce Back End

This project utilizes MySQL, Sequelize, Node.js, and Express.js to create a backend component for an e-commerce website. We use Express and Sequelize to interact with the MySQL database. The user can interact with the application by creating, updating, viewing and deleting the various categories and products that are present through the e-commerce application.
